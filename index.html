					      <p>DevOps engineers may take on specific roles, depending on their interests and the organisationsâ€™ needs. Among the types of DevOps engineers are:</p>
					          <ul>
							        <li><strong>Release manager:</strong> Manages ongoing software updates.</li>
								      <li><strong>Software developer:</strong> Writes code.</li>
								            <li><strong>Software tester:</strong> Tests code for bugs.</li>
									          <li><strong>Quality assurance engineer:</strong> Reviews and tests new code.</li>
										        <li><strong>Security engineer:</strong> Ensures the security of the software in the system.</li>
											      <li><strong>Automation engineer:</strong> Works to automate the software and systems.</li>
											          </ul>
												      <p>In India, tech giants like Oracle, Infosys, Accenture, Tech Mahindra, TCS, IBM, and Wipro are among the companies that regularly seek DevOps professionals.</p>

												          <p><strong>Technical skills</strong><br>
													      DevOps engineers are engineers first and foremost. In addition to traditional engineering skills, like maths and analytical thinking, you should understand:</p>
													      <ul>
														            <li><strong>Project management:</strong> As the person responsible for ensuring that a company's software is up-to-date, secure, and bug- and glitch-free, a DevOps engineer looks for and implements any relevant improvements constantly. A good DevOps engineer must have a firm grasp of the initiation, planning, execution, and monitoring of everything, from minor bug fixes to massive updates.</li>
															          <li><strong>Coding:</strong> Although some DevOps engineers may not always write code, they must still understand the fundamentals of whatever coding language is used.</li>
																        <li><strong>Server administration:</strong> DevOps engineers administer a company's networks and servers that host any software being created. This means creating accounts, updating permissions, and ensuring regular backups occur. They also set the procedures junior IT professionals follow when troubleshooting, debugging, or making other changes.</li>
																	      <li><strong>Service support:</strong> As a DevOps engineer, youâ€™ll provide on-call service for the systems and be responsible for performance monitoring, diagnostics, and failover and availability capabilities.</li>
																	          </ul>
